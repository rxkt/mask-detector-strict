Dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajmitra/covid-face-mask-detection-dataset/notebooks

The data folder with all images used was added to this repository to show the outcome of preprocessing the data using `face_crop.py`.
We achieve a 97~98% training accuracy, 93% test accuracy with our CNN model as opposed to a low 90% training accuracy, and an even lower test accuracy.
